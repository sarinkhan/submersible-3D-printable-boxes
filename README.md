# submersible-3D-printable-boxes
designs of 3D printable boxes meant to be submersed to various depths.
Some boxes may only be dust proof or splash proof.

The goal is to have a way to easily print boxes that can endure the pressure, and
find ways to seal those boxes to keep water from entering. As of now, only test design
are available, and i will print multiple prototypes to test how well they resist to the pressure.

The first box is meant to be entirely 3D printed, even the gasket. For that, the box itself must
be printed out of a solid material (PLA, ABS, nylon, etc), and the gasket must be printed with flexible
filament such as ninjaflex or semiflex. It is yet to be determined wich one is more efficient. 

In order to obtain the best results, the parts that are to be in contact
with the gasket should be printed to be in contact with the build plate, to have
the smoothest finish.

For the gasket, i didn't find a way to have it be smooth on both sides as of yet.
